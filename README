PHASTA-IO Conversion Tools. See http://redmine.scorec.rpi.edu/projects/phasta

To build,

git clone --recursive git://github.com/matthb2/phastaIO-converter.git
mkdir converter-build
CC=gcc CXX=g++ FC=gfortran cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../phastaIO-converter
make

To run, we first need to decide on some settings,

Number_of_parts = the number of PHASTA parts in your case. This is currently always equal to the number of PHASTA processes you will run. You should have a subdirectory n_procs-case where n is Number_of_parts

Number_of_files = The number of files in the converted output. Number_of_parts moduluo Number_of_files must be zero.

Number_of_processes = The number of converter processes you need to run. This must be an integer multiple of Number_of_files no larger than Number_of_parts. 

Timestep = The starting timestep from which you want to convert. Usually 0

Then change directories to your case directory and run 

phastaIO-converter/create_IO_O2N_input.sh Timestep Number_of_parts Number_of_files
mpirun -np Number_of_processes converter-build/bin/converterO2N

Obviously, you may need to adjust the paths. phastaIO-converter is assumed to be the path to this repository. converter-build is assumed to be the path to your build directory.
